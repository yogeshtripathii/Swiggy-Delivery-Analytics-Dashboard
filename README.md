# Swiggy-Delivery-Analytics-Dashboard
Worked with a Swiggy dataset to extract key insights related to revenue, order performance, and delivery patterns. The dataset provided details about individual orders, including delivery status, time, and the associated restaurant.

Total Revenue: The total revenue generated from all orders was calculated, providing an overall view of Swiggy’s financial performance across all transactions.

Revenue by Delivery Status:

Successful Delivery: I calculated the total revenue generated from successful deliveries, which reflects the core business income.
Cancelled Delivery: Additionally, I identified the revenue impact of cancelled deliveries, where orders were initiated but not completed.
Count of Deliveries:

Successful Deliveries: The total number of successful deliveries was determined, giving insight into operational efficiency.
Unsuccessful Deliveries: I also counted unsuccessful deliveries (including cancellations or failed orders), highlighting areas for potential improvement.
Top 5 Products to Order: Based on order frequency, I identified the top 5 products that were ordered the most. This provides a snapshot of popular consumer preferences on Swiggy.

Daywise Total Orders: I analyzed the total number of orders placed on each day, helping to understand daily demand trends and identify peak order days.

Weekday and Weekend Orders: I classified the orders into weekday and weekend categories. This segmentation helps in understanding the difference in consumer behavior during the week versus the weekend, which can be critical for promotional strategies.

Revenue by Restaurant: I broke down the total revenue by each restaurant, which showcases the top-performing partners and helps identify key contributors to the platform’s success.

Late Deliveries by Delivery Partner: Lastly, I calculated instances of late deliveries by each delivery partner. This analysis identifies which delivery partners are consistently exceeding the expected delivery times, allowing for potential adjustments to improve delivery performance.
